## Coder @ Calvin

[coder.cs.calvin.edu](https://coder.cs.calvinl.edu) allows you to set up workspaces in which you can run softare (like R) in a web browser.

### Step 1: Create a Coder Workspace 

You will only need to do this step once, and only if you don't already have a Coder workspace.

a.  If you don't already have a Coder Workspace, create one from teh Calvin CS Linux template.

b.  Name your workspace.

    Can't think of a good name? A default name will be suggested.

### Step 2: Access an application

You should see options like RStudio and VS Code Web, among others.  Choose RStudio unless you are familiar with VS Code 
and want to give that a try.  (More about VS Code [here](vscode.qmd).)

After a few seconds, you shoudl see a new window with an RStudio session:

:::{.callout-note}
#### Still running in your browser

Although this launches a new window, it is still a browser window.  RStudio is running on the Coder server, not on your 
device.

### Step 3: Do stuff

You now have a running R session inside RStudio and you are ready to go.

Next steps:

* [Get oriented to RStudio](rstudio.qmd)
* [Learn a little R](../basics/r-basics.qmd)
